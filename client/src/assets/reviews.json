A big \"Thank You\" to Shirley & Neves of SEE WORLD DESTINATIONS, as well as to Sharad, their Japanese associate, for seamlessly planning the group\\'s hour-wise itinerary of 7 cities in Japan alongwith Must-See sites (Bamboo Forest, GoldenTemple et al), with /strategically located hotels to convenient shopping arcades & scenic panorama (sea + landscape view from Hilton Hotel Odaiba was awesome & breathtaking), catering to meal requirements of different Indian culture segments in Japan (lovely treat) ... these tremendous initiatives are added assets to their vast industry knowledge & high standard of hospitality. Sharad was our \"Trip Advisor\", with his indepth /info on hotel room sizes vis-a-vis locations, niche advise on shopping & sightseeing. A special \"Arigato\" to Hisako-san & Miho-san, for their unfailing zest, patient explanations, talking, walking & tracking at evey tour site. Some noteworthy & some quirky takeaways of this memorable Japan trip :- ... Waste Management at its best - respecting environment, so carrying home one\\'s garbage. Japan\\'s clean street is witness to their clear vision on a sustainable future for subsequent generations. ... Steep learning curve when boarding the Bullet Train the 2nd time - excellent execution of 2-pronged entry ... Crisp navigation at the Shibuya Crossing - the sea of humans and live transportation respected all road and pedestrian regulations to the \\'T\\' ... Visiting 17 different Indian restaurants in Japan in a span of 10 days (it was a lovely treat - a feat which I never imagined would happen in Japan). ... \"Privacy\" button on the \\'Personal Hygiene Throne\\' which provided tidal-wave music to mask all other sounds of activity in the washroom cubicle.",

It was a wonderful trip, meticulously planned and executed by the duo of Ms Shirley & Mr Neves, who also accompanied us. The itinerary, across the main island of Japan, was very carefully planned to pack in visits to maximum no. of important & interesting places & sights within the limited time period without a bit of inconvenience. Hotels in the 5 places we stayed were carefully chosen & centrally located and very comfortable. Food throughout was excellent catering to different needs of the members of such a large group. The group comprised of mostly senior citizens and it was heartening to see the duo of Ms Shirley and Mr Neves lending personal touch to each aspect and looking after everyone, especially the elderly with kindness and compassion. It is not an easy job to manage such a large group, still they managed with aplomb and everyone in the group was praises for them. Very well done Seeworld and I would always choose them over any other travel agents. THANKS Seeworld for such a memorable trip, which will always be cherished and wish you all the very best.",

We visited cities like Tokyo, Nagoya, Hiroshima, Kyoto , Osaka and Kobe in 9 nights and 10 days. The tour was no doubt hectic and demanding , but was also an excellent one. Ours was group of 65 veterans and ladies( all senior citizens). Shirley & Neves of Seeworld went out of the way to make us comfortable during the tour. There are minor hiccups in every tour especially in a large group tour. Seeworld Destinations managed them well as & when they came up.

It was our first overseas outing with NFMC and SeeWorld and believe you me we enjoyed it to the hilt. NO REGRETS AT ALL. The only regret is that we both have put on little weight enjoying sumptuous lunches and dinners arranged at Indian restaurants during the trip. Considering a group of 60 touring members, hotel accommodation was good and well managed. Trip was meticulously planned to ensure that no time or opportunity is wasted and every minute of the tour is properly utilised for the site seeing. Tour guides were cheerful, tolerant and developed a very good rapport with the members. We were briefed about each and every site prior to our visit to the site. Above all, Cdr Vadhera�s efforts in bringing every touring member on the same page by conducting regular zoom meetings prior to commencement of the tour are well appreciated. Information exchanged through zoom meetings was relevant, detailed and exhaustive. Many basic issues and queries were resolved during the conduct of such meetings. Cdr Vadhera also had a very big responsibility on his shoulders to ensure that all members return home safely after an awesome trip. Hats off to Cdr Vadhera for not only arranging the trip but also for shouldering such a big responsibility. More than anything else, success of a tour comprising such large numbers depends upon the sense of cooperation, understanding and compassion displayed by members for each other. Given a chance, we are willing to join many more such tours in future under NFMC coordinated by M/s SeeWorld Destinations, Mumbai India. “Good Luck All the Best� (Mrs & Cdr RK Mehta, Retd )",

Few suggestions : (1) Lunch could be skipped to save time n also a fully tummy post lunch is not too interesting. A small packed snacks should have sufficed. (2) More detailed explanation of place of visits (3) Group checkin at Osaka airport could have been better organised. One single line formation as was insisted by the airport staff was not being adhered to, poor show. We project a poor image of our country by these chaotic scenes. More foresight to manage such situations reqd. just for eg. Bullet train management was good as prior briefing was well done otherwise overall good",

One of the two Japanese tour guides assigned to the group knew a smattering of Hindi in addition o English, a big plus for those who are less than confident in English. Same way, the hotels chosen for us in different locations had Nepalese boys and girls working there. They had a better understanding of the Indian needs. A BIG PLUS FOR THE TOUR OPERATOR. 4. For us, two amongst many vegetarians on the tour, arrangements were made for tasty vegetarian meals. We were also given the option of tasty vegetarian Japanese meals, which we exercised and found the Japanese meals were different but good. 5.

         "Text":"Experience was most wonderful! Every detail was considered and taken care of by the organising team. Personal interest taken by Seeworld Destinations was the most touching factor. Any successful venture depends on the interest taken to put it together. Catering for a variety of customers is difficult for any business especially the hospitality and travels businesses. What matters most is a patient hearing of the customer and sincere efforts to resolve issues if any. All aspects were good but if I were to compare and rate then.... Best trip - visit to Changu lake & Baba Mandir. Best Hotel stay - At Shillong. Best Food - Assamese fare at Kaziranga. Best cultural experience - Cultural program at Kaziranga. Best educational experience - Don Bosco Museum at Shillong. Best city/place - Gangtok. Suggestions- (1) Need to cater for rest and recuperation at regular intervals especially for a aged group. The trip can be hectic and so much travel in so few days can take a toll on health. (2) More educational experience is desirable - visit to Don Bosco museum type! The tour guides need to explain more and tell more interesting stories about the place of visit. Today as it is so much is available on internet. So the customer wants more! (3) Local food and a vareity of food options is appreciated. Same food (like Gulab Jamun and Paneer) at all places can be boring and a let down. (4) More cultural events like the Song and Dance show at Kaziranga is appreciated. Maybe some local music or dance can be added at each destination. That will make the trips more interesting. I am sure most of us will be wanting more - maybe North East Part 2! Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Mizoram, and maybe Manipur!",
