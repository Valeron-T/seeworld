         "Text":"Experience was most wonderful! Every detail was considered and taken care of by the organising team. Personal interest taken by Seeworld Destinations was the most touching factor. Any successful venture depends on the interest taken to put it together. Catering for a variety of customers is difficult for any business especially the hospitality and travels businesses. What matters most is a patient hearing of the customer and sincere efforts to resolve issues if any. All aspects were good but if I were to compare and rate then.... Best trip - visit to Changu lake & Baba Mandir. Best Hotel stay - At Shillong. Best Food - Assamese fare at Kaziranga. Best cultural experience - Cultural program at Kaziranga. Best educational experience - Don Bosco Museum at Shillong. Best city/place - Gangtok. Suggestions- (1) Need to cater for rest and recuperation at regular intervals especially for a aged group. The trip can be hectic and so much travel in so few days can take a toll on health. (2) More educational experience is desirable - visit to Don Bosco museum type! The tour guides need to explain more and tell more interesting stories about the place of visit. Today as it is so much is available on internet. So the customer wants more! (3) Local food and a vareity of food options is appreciated. Same food (like Gulab Jamun and Paneer) at all places can be boring and a let down. (4) More cultural events like the Song and Dance show at Kaziranga is appreciated. Maybe some local music or dance can be added at each destination. That will make the trips more interesting. I am sure most of us will be wanting more - maybe North East Part 2! Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Mizoram, and maybe Manipur!",
